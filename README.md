# AI-Based Material Recommendation System

An end-to-end intelligent material recommendation platform that predicts suitable materials for specific industrial use cases based on environment, strength, durability, eco-preferences, and more. The system integrates ML models with LLM-based analysis to assist engineers and manufacturers in sustainable material selection.

---

## Features

- Predicts top 3 suitable materials from 22 options using machine learning.
- Integrated with Gemini LLM for detailed analysis, cost comparison, and insights.
- Tracked and logged experiments using MLflow.
- Frontend deployed with **Vercel**, backend deployed with **Docker + AWS EC2**.
- Model, encoder, and scaler saved using `pickle` for reproducible inference.

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Data Points**: 1050+
- **Columns**:
  - `Environment`
  - `Required_Strength`
  - `Durability_Priority`
  - `Eco_Preference`
  - `Application_Area`
  - `Max_Lead_Time`
  - `Material_Name` (target)

---

## ML Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled nulls, outliers, encoded categorical, scaled numerical).

2. **Model Training with MLflow**  
   Evaluated multiple models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, etc.). Logged runs and metrics using MLflow.

3. **Best Model**  
   Random Forest with ~84% accuracy selected. Saved:
   - `model.pkl`
   - `scaler.pkl`
   - `encoder.pkl`

4. **LLM Integration**  
   Top 3 predicted materials passed to **Gemini LLM** via prompt to get:
   - Ranked recommendation
   - Competitor analysis
   - Cost and performance remarks
